# CS2340_SecondProject (Spotify Wrapped)

### Description
We developed an Android application tailored for music enthusiasts, offering a fun and engaging way to explore their music preferences. Our app provides more frequent music summaries than Spotify Wrapped, giving users regular insights into their listening habits.

Users can log into our app using their Spotify accounts to link their accounts with our app. The app securely stores their account data, using it to create detailed and visually engaging summaries of their music listening habits. Past Spotify Wrapped summaries are also preserved, enabling users to track and analyze how their music tastes have evolved over time. Additionally, users have the flexibility to update their login details or delete their account whenever they choose.

We implemented the following user stories and features:

- Wrapped Summary:
- Login/Past Wraps:
- Holiday Versions:
- New Artists:
- Timespan Options:
- CI/CD Pipeline:
- Export Summary:
- Firebase:
- Settings:
