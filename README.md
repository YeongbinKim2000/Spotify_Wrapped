# CS2340_SecondProject (Spotify Wrapped)

### Description
We developed an Android application tailored for music enthusiasts, offering a fun and engaging way to explore their music preferences. Our app provides more frequent music summaries than Spotify Wrapped, giving users regular insights into their listening habits.

Users can log into our app using their Spotify accounts to link their accounts with our app. The app securely stores their account data, using it to create detailed and visually engaging summaries of their music listening habits. Past Spotify Wrapped summaries are also preserved, enabling users to track and analyze how their music tastes have evolved over time. Additionally, users have the flexibility to update their login details or delete their account whenever they choose.

We implemented the following user stories and features:

- Wrapped Summary: This allows the user to view a presentation of the different variations of their personal Spotify music listening tastes in a colorful and fun manner. It also lets the user log into their personal account from the app.
- Login/Past Wraps: The user can create account and log into app itself to view their past wrapped summaries. Their data will be stored so that their account information is saved after exiting the app. They are also able to update their account information and delete their account as they wish.
- Holiday Versions: Special holiday versions of the user's wrapped summaries are generated and accessible to view on specific days of the year. Our app has versions for Halloween, Christmas, and Easter.
- New Artists: Based on the user's music tastes, the app also recommends new artists.
- Timespan Options: The user is able to control the timespan of the generated wrapped summaries. The time intervals include 1 week, 1 month, and 1 year.
- CI/CD Pipeline: Developers can utilize a CI/CD pipeline to test code and verify that it builds and is formatted correctly.
- Export Summary: Users can export a summary of their Wrapped as an image file. This allows them to easily copy and share with others outside of the app.
- Firebase: Firebase implementation lets the user sign into their account from any device.
- Settings: The settings page allows the user to access different types of functionality in one screen - notifications, dark mode, update and delete account.
